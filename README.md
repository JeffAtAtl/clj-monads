# clj-monads

Some code examples to accompany my talk to the Atlanta Clojure Meetup: http://www.meetup.com/Atl-Clj/events/134235482/

Examples taken largely from:
* [Learn You a Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* [algo.monad](https://github.com/clojure/algo.monads) author Konrad Hinson's [monad tutorial](http://onclojure.com/2009/03/05/a-monad-tutorial-for-clojure-programmers-part-1/)

This is something of a sister talk to my [monads talk at ATLRUG](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/rb-monads).
