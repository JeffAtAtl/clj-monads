; Monads are a means of extending pure function composition
; You can think of them as "composition with *context*"
; A (by no means exhaustive) list of examples:
; * maybe - with failure propagation
; * seq   - with non-determinism
; * state - with state manipulation
; * io    - with io actions
; * ident - with imperative variable binding

; To accomplish this extended composition, each monad `m` must define two operations
; * result :: a -> m(a) - takes a regular non-monadic value and embeds it into the
;                         minimal context needed by the monad 
; * bind :: m(a) -> (a -> m(b)) -> m(b) - takes a value with extra monadic context and
;                                         feeds it through a function which does not a
;                                         priori know how to interpret that context
;
; So a monad consists of three ingredients:
; - a data structure for storing extra computation context
; - a definition of result
; - a definition of bind







; Let's start by looking at the simplest monad, identity:

; A not-so-evil (read: highly localized) use of state
(let [a 2
      b (inc a)]
  (* a b))

; We can eradicate all traces of imperativism and write this purely functionally as
( (fn [a]
  ( (fn [b]
    (* a b)
  ) (inc a))
) 2)

; This is the key idea behind using a monad to emulate imperative variable binding.
; As written though, this expression is a little convoluted (amongst other problems,
; it reads the wrong way). 
;
; Happily, there are several constructs to make this easier.
(use 'clojure.algo.monads)

; Witness:
(def alt-let '(domonad identity-m
  [a 2
   b (inc a)]
  (* a b)))
(eval alt-let)

; Which expands to:
(macroexpand-1 alt-let) ; => (clojure.algo.monads/with-monad identity-m (m-bind 2 (fn [a] (m-bind (inc a) (fn [b] (m-result (* a b)))))))

; In the case of the identity monad, identity-m, we have
 
(defn identity-bind [val fn] (fn val))
(defn identity-result [val] val)

; so that expression works out to exactly the nested-function form above

; The definition of indentity-m should make the name clear: result is the identity map, there is no
; extra context, and bind is simple function application. The "magic" here is handled by the `domonad`
; macro which converts let syntax into a chain of pure monadic function calls. Thus you can think of this
; do-notation as imperative syntax embedded in a pure functional setting. 

; `domonad` works equally well for any monad, but different monads will have different semantics about
;  what `m-bind` and `m-result` represent. Because of this, monads have been described as "functional DSLs" 
;  or "programmable semicolons". Let's take a look at several other (less trivial) monads:








;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; MAYBE - failure propagation ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; The maybe monad represents computations that might have failed. Here "failed" compositions are represented
; by the special value `nil`. To define this monad, we need an implementation of bind which can handle that
; extra failure possibility:

(defn maybe-bind [val fn]
  (if (nil? val)
    nil
    (fn val)))

; You can read this as "if we try to chain a failed computation, pass the failure forward. Otherwise, compute as normal"

; Here's a slight modification of our earlier example using a function that might "fail"
(defn pos-inc [x]
  (if (pos? x)
    (inc x)
    nil))

(defn monadize [m x]
  (domonad m
           [a x
            b (pos-inc a)]
           (* a b)))

(def ident-mult (partial monadize identity-m))
(def maybe-mult (partial monadize maybe-m))

; Try it out:
; (ident-mult 2)
; (maybe-mult 2)
; (ident-mult -2)
; (maybe-mult -2)





; MONAD FREEBIE #1 - chaining

; (m-chain [f g h]) is equivalent to
; (fn [arg]
;   (domonad
;     [x (f arg)
;      y (g x)
;      z (h y)]
;     z))
; So `m-chain` is something like a monadic version of `->`, feeding values through a sequence of functions:
(with-monad maybe-m
  (def mult-3 (m-chain [maybe-mult maybe-mult maybe-mult])))

; (mult-3 1)
; (mult-3 -7)

; This gives us a convenient and pure way of propagating errors forward to the point where we can most naturally
; handle them, without requiring any imperative throw / catch code







; MONAD FREEBIE #2 - lifting

(with-monad maybe-m
  (def lifted-+ (m-lift 2 +)))

; This is equivalent to
(fn [x y]
  (domonad maybe-m
           [a x
            b y]
           (+ a b)))
; The "natural lift" of + into this monad. Note that we have to specify the arity of the function we're lifting
; since there's no way to infer it.

; Try it out:
; (+ 8 13)
; (lifted-+ 8 13)

(defn failing-fn [] nil)
; (+ 1 (failing-fn))
; (lifted-+ 1 (failing-fn))









;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; SEQ - non-determinism ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; If `identity-m` was a functional version of `let`, `sequence-m` is a functional `for`
; It deals with looping and iterating. You can view it as "composition with non-determinism"
; since returning a list of values can be thought of as saying "any of these answers are
; possible".

; sequence monadic values will be represented by a sequence (typically a list), so we need two functions
; result :: a -> [a]
; bind :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
; In this case,
(defn sequence-result [v]
  (list v))
(defn sequence-bind [s f]
  (apply concat (map f s)))
; the `concat` call is there so that we don't pick up an extra layer of nesting in the proccess

(for [a (range 5)
      b (range a)]
  (* a b))

(def alt-for 
  '(domonad sequence-m
    [a (range 5)
     b (range a)]
    (* a b)))
(eval alt-for)

; Let's remind ourselves what that's actually doing:
(macroexpand-1 alt-for) ; => (clojure.algo.monads/with-monad sequence-m (m-bind (range 5) (fn [a] (m-bind (range a) (fn [b] (m-result (* a b)))))))

; Or, slightly re-written:
; (m-bind (range 5) (fn [a]
; (m-bind (range a) (fn [b]
; (m-result (* a b))))))

; The inner bind gives us essentially
; (apply concat (map (fn [b] (list (* a b)) (range a))))
; which is the "loop over range a". The outer bind handles the outer loop similarly.




; Example: hierarchy traversal
; `parents` :: Class -> [Class], so while we can't compose iterations natively, we can in the sequence monad
(defn nth-parents [n cls]
  (with-monad sequence-m
    ( (m-chain (replicate n parents)) cls )))

; (nth-parents 0 (class []))
; (nth-parents 1 (class []))
; (nth-parents 2 (class []))




; Example: knight moves
; Here we use a monadic for to construct the board just because:
(def board
  (domonad set-m ; This uses sets instead of lists, but otherwise is identical to sequence-m
    [row (range 1 9)
     col (range 1 9)]
    [row col]))
; (print board)

(defn possible-moves [start]
  (let [[x y] start]
    (domonad set-m
             [xdir [+ -]
              xmov [1 2]
              ydir [+ -]]
             [(apply xdir [x xmov]) (apply ydir [y (- 3 xmov)])] ))); ymov = 2 if xmov = 1 and vice versa

; (possible-moves [0 0])

(defn moves [start]
  (clojure.set/select board (possible-moves start))) 

(defn draw [squares]
  (loop [i 1]
    (when (< i 9)
      (loop [j 1]
        (when (< j 9)
          (print (cond
            (squares [i j]) "KK"
            (odd? (+ i j))  "++"
            :else           "  "))
          (recur (inc j))))
      (print "\n")
      (recur (inc i))))
  squares)

; (draw (moves [1 1]))
; (draw (moves [4 4]))

; Again, moves :: Square -> #{Squares} but we can use the monad to "compose" it with itself
(defn nth-moves [n start] 
  (with-monad set-m
    ( (m-chain (replicate n moves)) start ))) 

; (draw (nth-moves 1 [1 1]))
; (draw (nth-moves 2 [1 1]))
; (draw (nth-moves 3 [1 1]))






; MONAD FREEBIE #3 - fmap

; Note that we can define a simple `map` entirely in terms of the monad:
(defn monad-map [m f col]
  (domonad m
    [x col]
    (f x)))

; When m is `sequence-m`, this is exactly map:
(monad-map sequence-m 
           #(* % 2) (range 3))

; But it is a similar construction for any monadic value, viewed as a container:
(monad-map maybe-m
           #(* % 2) 7)
(monad-map maybe-m
           #(* % 2) (failing-fn))

; In each case, we're extracting values from out of the monadic context before
; applying the non-monadic function to them.




; There are several other freebies, all seen in the (very readible)
; https://github.com/clojure/algo.monads/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/algo/monads.clj#L28
; * m-map and m-fmap
; * m-join
; * m-seq
; * m-reduce
; * m-until
; * m-when
; * m-when-not





; Digression: Functors

; As we've just seen, we can think of monadic values as being containers holding
; things that we can map over. In other words, they are functors:

; A functor is a constructor `f` along with a function `fmap` :: (a -> b) -> f(a) -> f(b)

; The canonical example of a functor is list with fmap = map, but as we've seen,
; `maybe-m` provides another. Binary trees are another fairly natural functor,
; but they can include anything from function composition to exotic mathematical
; invariants.

; Technically, functor fmaps should satisfy
; - fmap id = id
; - (fmap f) . (fmap g) = fmap (f . g)
; These follow from similar monad laws which we probably won't have time to get
; into.




; Note that instead of mapping a single function over a collection, the monad
; structure of sequence-m allows us to do:
(defn sequence-m-ap [functions values]
  (domonad sequence-m
    [f functions
     v values]
    (f v)))
; which applies each function to each value in turn:
(sequence-m-ap [#(* %1 2) #(* %1 %1)] (range 1 6))

; A constructor with this sort of structure is called an Applicative
; It's not hard to show that:
;   Monad => Applicative => Functor
; Though, unfortunately, we won't have many examples of interesting applicative
; structures until we learn about the state monad.




; Example: a custom probability monad
; As mentioned, we can view `sequence-m` as representing non-determinism. It isn't hard to define
; our own monad extending this idea and attaching a probability to each possible value:
(defmonad prob-m
  [m-result (fn [v] {v 1})
   m-bind (fn [mv f]
            (letfn [(add-prob [dist [x p]]
                      (assoc dist x (+ (get dist x 0) p)))]
              (reduce add-prob {}
                (for [[x p] mv 
                      [y q] (f x)]
                  [y (* q p)]))))
   ])
; (This monad is actually in clojure.contrib.probabilities.finite-distributions)

; Much like the functor rules, there are some laws that custom monads should satisfy:
; (=
;  (m-bind (m-result v) f)
;  (f v))
; 
; (=
;  (m-bind mv m-result)
;  mv)
; 
; (=
;  (m-bind (m-bind mv f) g)
;  (m-bind mv #(m-bind (f %) g)))


; We can use this monad to investigate the classic (and counterintuitive) Monty Hall problem:
(defn choose [coll]
  "Creates a uniform probability distribution from the given collection"
 (let [prob (/ 1 (count coll))]
   (into {} (map vector coll (repeat prob)))))

(defn doors [n]
  (set (map char (range 65 (+ 65 n)))))

; (doors 3)
; (choose (doors 3))

(defn reveal [prize choice]
  (if (= choice prize) :win :lose))

(defn monty-stay [n]
  "The probability of winning the Monty Hall game on n doors if you choose to stay"
  (domonad prob-m
           [prize  (choose (doors n))
            choice (choose (doors n))]
           (reveal prize choice)))

; (monty-stay 3)
; (monty-stay 4)

(defn monty-switch [n]
  "The probability of winning the Monty Hall game on n doors if you choose to switch"
  (domonad prob-m
           [prize        (choose (doors n))
            first-choice (choose (doors n))
            opened       (choose (disj (doors n) prize first-choice))
            next-choice  (choose (disj (doors n) opened first-choice))]
           (reveal prize next-choice)))

; (monty-switch 3)
; (monty-switch 4)

; STATE - side-effects ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; We've seen how monads can act like a dsl where we specify imperative-looking
; code, but it gets translated into pure functions behind the scenes. An
; extension of that idea is the State monad.

; So far, monadic values have been primative values, lists, or maps. In the
; state monad, we think of building up procedures, represented by functions
;   start-state -> [value end-state]
; Each monadic composition should extend the procedure we're building, but the
; process itself is still purely functional. In the end, we can "run" a stateful
; procedure by feeding in a start state (typically represented by a map)

(defn average [k l]
  "Performs finds the average of two stateful variables, storing the sum in the process"
  (domonad state-m
           [a (fetch-val k)
            b (fetch-val l)
            _ (set-val :sum (+ a b))
            sum (fetch-val :sum)]
           (/ sum 2)))

(let [initial {:a 10, :b 20}
      manip   (average :a :b)
      [result final] (manip initial)]
  {:result result, :final final})

; Let's see how it accomplishes this (from the source):
(defmonad state-m
     [m-result  (fn m-result-state [v]
                  (fn [s] [v s]))
      m-bind    (fn m-bind-state [mv f]
                  (fn [s]
                    (let [[v ss] (mv s)]
                      ((f v) ss))))
     ])
; Here we see that finding the state after a bound step function is a matter of checking
; 1. the state after applying the operations represented by the monad value up to that point (mv)
; 2. the result of the stateful operation (f v) applied to that state
